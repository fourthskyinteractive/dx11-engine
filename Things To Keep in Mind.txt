Deferred Contexts - 	When Creating the D3DDevice, you create the immediate context that 
			will run on the main thread.  You use D3D11CreateDeferredContext() to
			create additional deferred contexts that will be run on separate threads.
			There will be one deferred context per separate thread and only one 
			immediate context on the main thread.

MultiSampling -		If you want to change the multisampling settings at runtime, you have
			to destroy and recreate the swap chain.

Back Buffer -		To obtain a pointer to the backbuffer object, you must call IDXGISwapChain::GetBuffer().
			The first parameter being the back buffer index that you want to get, most cases 0,
			the second parameter being the interface type, usually ID3D11Texture2D, and the third
			parameter being the return pointer to the back buffer.

Deferred Rendering - 	To Do Deferred Rendering With Multiple RenderTargetViews
			--------------------------------------------------------
			* Create additional RenderTargetViews to draw to.
				-These are texture2D's that you can then send to the shader as 
	 			 shaderResourceViews.
			* Basically deferred rendering is rendering to multiple textures and then rendering
  			  them all to one quad that is the size of the screen.  When you render them all you
  			  pass them all as ShaderResourceViews and then "blend" them to get the appropirate image.
			* You still need to get the pointer to the back buffer and remember which RenderTargetView is
			  that back buffer so when you finally output your final Texture you will have to do it to that
			  RenderTargetView and then present which will swap that with the front buffer and render it to
			  the screen.

Blend States - 		Blend states allow you to either have a different blend state for each render target or the same
			blend state for every render target.  If you want multiple blend states you have to set the
			IndependentBlendEnable flag to true.  Once this is set, when you set the blend states 0-7, they
			will coorespond to the render targets that you currently have bound.  If you have all 8 bound,
			(Ex: OMSetRenderTargets(8, &renderTargets[0], depthStencilBuffer);) the blend state and render 
			target will both be the same indices.  Ex: renderTarget[0] will be blended using blendState[0]. 
			If you aren't binding all the render targets (Ex: OMSetRenderTargets(7, &renderTargets[1], depthStencilBuffer);)
			the blendstate[0] will coorespond to the first renderTarget at the address that you bound from.
			Ex: renderTarget[1] will be blended using blendState[0].

Vertex Buffer Array -	Make an array of Vertex Buffers.  When you set the vertex buffer know that you are using an array
			and make sure that the parameter passed to that function matches the number of buffers in the array.

Shader In's - 		You can pass information to the shaders via a structure or through the paramater list in its main.  Know
			that if you pass by parameter, the shader will disreguard any information following what it expects
			to receive.
