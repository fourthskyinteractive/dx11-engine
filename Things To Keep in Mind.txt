Deferred Contexts - 	When Creating the D3DDevice, you create the immediate context that 
			will run on the main thread.  You use D3D11CreateDeferredContext() to
			create additional deferred contexts that will be run on separate threads.
			There will be one deferred context per separate thread and only one 
			immediate context on the main thread.

MultiSampling -		If you want to change the multisampling settings at runtime, you have
			to destroy and recreate the swap chain.

Back Buffer -		To obtain a pointer to the backbuffer object, you must call IDXGISwapChain::GetBuffer().
			The first parameter being the back buffer index that you want to get, most cases 0,
			the second parameter being the interface type, usually ID3D11Texture2D, and the third
			parameter being the return pointer to the back buffer.
